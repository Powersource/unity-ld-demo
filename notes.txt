- I'll be making a small, very simple 2d platformer from scratch.
- I won't go into detail on every aspect but please feel free to ask questions if you want anything clarified.
* Install unity
* Create a 2d-project
* Make sure it's actually 2d or else just recreate it
* Import a spritesheet
* Split it (16x16 with 1 padding for me)
* Remove anisotropic filtering if it's low-res i.e. bilinear->point
* Set pixels per unit to 16. 1 unit is intended to be rougly one meter. It's not required but stuff will generally be easier if you set this value with that in mind.
* Drag a floor sprite into the scene, stretch its width
* Give the floor a 2d box collider component
- The collider lets it collide with other objects that also have colliders.
* Drag a player sprite into the scene, above the floor
* Give it Rigidbody 2d and Polygon collider 2d components
- The Rigidbody makes it affected by the unity physics e.g. makes it affected by gravity.
- The Polygon collider is just like the box collider except that its edges can move around more liberally. When creating it unity tries to fit it to the sprite the best it can but you might have to adjust it yourself.
* Rename both objects to something more appropriate. If this doesn't make sense now it will later.
* Try pressing the play button, your character should land on the static ground
* Go back into the scene view while the game is running. Drag the player around.
* Stop the game
- Notice that the player position gets reset when you stop the game. Very very common mistake to actually change stuff you want to keep while playing. There are ways of making the editor change colors more dramatically when playing.
* Add a script component to eg. the Main Camera. See the repo for final code with comments.
- Do it in c#. Especially if you've ever coded in java, it will be easy to make the shift and you will realize that c# is a better language anyway. This js might look like the js you're used to but you can't exactly import jquery.
- Adding scripts directly to GameObjects (apart from the main one) is generally a bad idea, at least in my opinion. It just ends up as a weird form of visual scripting.
- I also think the scene editor should be kept as a map/level editor with spawning and logic left to one or a few scripts placed on a dedicated script holding empty object. Though it can also be useful when prototyping, or you know, doing a game jam. It is large part preference when to use it and my answer to it might be bad too.
* Open the script in monodevelop which comes with unity. Scripts will open in it by default if you open them from unity.
- In my experience monodevelop is shit but there are more or less hacky ways of swapping it for something else.
- Please excuse the code formatting, it's monodevelop default and changing it is not close to fun in a better editor.
* Drag a sprite into the scene to serve as a platform to jump on and give it a Box collider 2D.
- So I created this project as a 2d project but that only sets a couple of defaults, otherwise it is the same as a 3d project. If you press the 2d button at the top of the scene view you can view the 2d scene in 3d.
- Most differences between 2/3d is in how you create the game. While every base Gameobject needs a sprite in 2d, the 3d equivalent is a model with a material/texture. And when adding physics components they have to be from the regular Physics menu instead of the 2d Physics menu. They act different and can't interact with one another but are similar in many ways.
- Check out the asset store, especially anything published by Unity Technologies. Lots of free stuff including stuff like prebuilt 3d character controllers. Note that you're only allowed to use this if you enter the jam and not the compo. Speaking of rules, you should read them http://ludumdare.com/compo/rules/
