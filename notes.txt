* Install unity
* Create a 2d-project
* Make sure it's actually 2d or else just recreate it
* Import a spritesheet
* Split it (16x16 with 1 padding for me)
* Remove anisotropic filtering if it's low-res i.e. bilinear->point
* Drag a floor sprite into the scene, stretch its width
* Give the floor a 2d box collider
